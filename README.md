## 📋 Process Flow

1. **🚀 Start**: The chatbot system initializes.

2. **📥 Loading Data**: Necessary data is loaded into the system to ensure the chatbot has all the information it needs to function.

3. **📊 Creating Vectors**: The loaded data is transformed into vectors, enabling quick retrieval of relevant information.

4. **🔍 Retrieving Vectors from VectorDB**: The chatbot retrieves the necessary vectors from the vector database to find the best possible matches for user queries.

5. **🔗 Calling API for Google Gemini Pro LLM**: The chatbot makes an API call to the Google Gemini Pro language model to leverage its advanced language processing capabilities.

6. **🔄 LLM Chain**: The chatbot processes the language model chain to understand and generate appropriate responses.

7. **🎯 Instruction Fine Tuning**: Fine-tuning instructions are applied to the model to improve accuracy and relevance.

8. **🧠 RAG Chain**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain is invoked to enhance the response generation process.

9. **💬 Invoking RAG Chain to Answer Queries**: The RAG chain helps the chatbot generate precise and relevant answers to user queries.

10. **📤 Getting Response**: The chatbot compiles the response and presents it to the user.

11. **🤔 User Satisfaction Check**: The chatbot checks if the user is satisfied with the response:
    - If the user is **satisfied**, the process ends.
    - If the user is **not satisfied**, the process loops back to the RAG chain to try answering the query again.
